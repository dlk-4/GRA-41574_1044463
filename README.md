# Machine Learning–Enhanced Pairs Trading in Crypto and Equity Markets

This repository provides a reusable PairsTradingPipeline class (PairsTradingPipeline.py) that automates data loading, spread and Z-score construction, ML feature/label generation, threshold optimization, model training, and Z-only vs ML-filtered backtesting and plot Price data, spread, Z-score, and Correlation Matrix. Simply import PairsTradingPipeline to run new experiments on any asset pair. All figures, metrics, and analysis are contained in results_analysis.ipynb, which demonstrates how the pipeline works in practice and summarizes the empirical results.
