# GRA 41574 (Big) Data Curation, Pipelines and Management

This repository provides a reusable PairsTradingPipeline class that automates data loading, spread and Z-score construction, ML feature/label generation, threshold optimization, model training, and Z-only vs ML-filtered backtesting and plot Correlation Matrix. Simply import PairsTradingPipeline to run new experiments on any asset pair. All figures, metrics, and analysis are contained in results_analysis.ipynb, which demonstrates how the pipeline works in practice and summarizes the empirical results.
